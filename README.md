# sam-scavenging
This is a QB Core scavenging script which allows the players to search/loot bins and other various trash items and level up their XP in return of finding better items.

# Dependencies
Ox Lib
Ox MySQL

# Support
I have recently switched to making QBox resources so I am unaware if this script will function properly inside of QBox
